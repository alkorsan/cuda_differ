def split_lines_safe(text: str) -> tp.List[str]:
    """Split text into lines on \\n, \\r\\n, or \\r ONLY.

    Drop-in replacement for text.splitlines(True) that does NOT treat
    VT, FF, NEL, LS, PS...etc as line boundaries (see comment above _LINE_SPLIT_RE).
    Keepends behavior is preserved: each returned line includes its
    original terminator, matching what splitlines(True) callers expect.
    A trailing terminator-less remainder (if the text doesn't end in a
    line ending) is included as the final element with no terminator,
    same as splitlines(True). Empty input returns [].

    Details:
    splitlines splits on the following 11 line boundaries: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.splitlines
    - \\n Line Feed
    - \\r Carriage Return
    - \\r\\n Carriage Return + Line Feed
    - \\v or \\x0b Line Tabulation (Vertical Tab (VT))
    - \\f or \\x0c Form Feed (Page Break)
    - \\x1c File Separator (FS, \\u001C)
    - \\x1d Group Separator (GS, \\u001D):
    - \\x1e Record Separator (RS, \\u001E)
    - \\x85 Next Line (C1 Control Code, NEL, \\u0085)
    - \\u2028 Line Separator (LS)
    - \\u2029 Paragraph Separator (PS)

    This functions splits *text* into a list of lines, keeping each line's terminator
    appended (matching str.splitlines(True)'s keepends=True contract),
    but splitting ONLY on \\r\\n, \\r, \\n -- NOT on NEL/VT/FF/LS/PS...etc.
    This matches how CudaText stores lines internally: a line containing
    an embedded NEL/VT/FF/LS/PS...etc is a single logical line, not two.
    A trailing empty element (after a final terminator) is dropped, so
    "abc\\n" -> ["abc\\n"] -- same as str.splitlines(True).

    CudaText's editor only treats CR, LF, and CRLF as line breaks; the other
    characters stay inside a single logical line and are rendered as
    in-line control pictures. Using str.splitlines() here would split on
    those extra characters too, producing more "lines" than the editor
    actually has, which causes every diff event line index to drift out
    of sync with the editor (see _refresh_ex).

    Why I use re.finditer and not str.split(): split() can't do this job at all, for one structural reason -- it discards the delimiter. "a\\r\\nb".split('\\r\\n') gives you ['a', 'b'] with the \\r\\n gone. But set_seqs/unidiff call this with keepends=True semantics -- every line needs its original terminator still attached, because the diff engine uses that terminator when reconstructing/rendering output. So whatever splits also has to capture what it split on.
    Three ways to get delimiter-preserving split, ranked:
    1. re.split() with a capturing group — re.split(r'(\\r\\n|\\r|\\n)', text) returns alternating content/delimiter pieces you'd then have to re-zip back together in a loop. Works, but it's an extra reconstruction pass for no benefit over option 2.
    2. finditer (what I used) — one pass, and at each match I already have m.end(), so I slice text[pos:m.end()] directly — content and its trailing terminator in one slice, no reassembly step. This is what I wrote.
    3. Manual two-pointer scan (no regex) — check each position for \\r, \\n, or \\r\\n by hand, same asymptotic cost, more code, easier to get the "is this \\r followed by \\n" lookahead wrong. Not worth it here.
    There's a subtlety str.split() would also get wrong even ignoring the discard problem: splitting on \\r and \\n as separate single-char delimiters (e.g. chaining two .split() calls, or re.split(r'[\\r\\n]')) treats \\r\\n as two boundaries, producing a spurious empty string between them. My pattern lists r'\\r\\n|\\r|\\n' with \\r\\n first, so regex alternation matches the two-char sequence before it'd consider the lone \\r — that ordering is why CRLF collapses to one boundary instead of two. If I'd written r'\\r|\\n|\\r\\n' instead, alternation still tries left-to-right per position, so \\r would win before \\r\\n got a chance and you'd get the same double-split bug. It's already correctly ordered in the delivered code, but worth knowing why the ordering matters if you ever touch that pattern.

    and finditer is faster than re.split() in my tests
